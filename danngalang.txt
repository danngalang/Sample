you gave the reason for my being and i love what Im feeling
I wanna make you smile whenever you're sad carry you around when your arthritis is bad all I wanna do is grow old with you
You give me hope the strength, the will to keep on no one else can make me feel this way and only you can bring out all the best i can do
You pushed me up when i'm about to give up you're on my side when no one seems to listen and if you go
